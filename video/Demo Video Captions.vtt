All right so this is our demo video! We've got
a couple visualizations but I'm going to start

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.900
with the scatter plot, which plots songs based on
axes that the user can customize. Right now it's

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
a popularity versus popularity comparison which
isn't that interesting, but we can change it to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.740
like a danceability versus energy comparison and
we can see that you know it's plotted the songs

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.020
that way which is kind of cool. We can then hover
over songs to see their values so we can hover

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.100
this one and it'll be like a movie soundtrack I
guess, which has a pretty low energy and a pretty

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.660
low danceability which checks out. We can click
on a song and we can either like it, dislike it,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.460
or dislike similar songs. So firstly, let's say
I want to like this so let's give it a like.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.520
And now I'll go to my second visualization
here which analyzes a playlist. So liking it added

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.840
it to our liked songs playlist, and we can view
all the songs in that playlist. What the bar

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
chart does it displays averages for the songs
in the playlist. So there's only one song in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.100
there, so this has a 64 popularity I guess. We can
also add more to our liked songs, like let's add

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.740
something completely different, like Big And
Chunky, which hey you know that'll be more popular!

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.580
Or, actually, it's less popular, it's 60.5. So there
you go. This displays averages. You can add a new

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.820
playlist too. Let's add, I don't know, some random
playlist here, and we can go ahead and switch to it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
and there's nothing in there. But we can go ahead
and add songs to it, such as anything down here.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.280
Let's add a miracle sleep tone to it, and it'll
populate with that also. Another thing we can do is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.900
dislike songs, like, I don't want to see any miracle
sleep tones in my playlist! So, let's go ahead and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.580
dislike it and that'll actually remove it from
the scatter plot, and it will never be displayed

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.380
in scatter plot anymore. We can also dislike
similar songs. We wrote an algorithm to see

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
how similar one song is to another, comparing all
the attributes, so we can dislike similar songs and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.520
remove a bunch of other songs from being displayed.
So, this will remove a whole bunch of stuff. A lot

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.300
of it seems like movie soundtracks and other very
slow, calm songs. So yeah! We can compare songs with

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.380
the scatter plot and add songs to playlists
and we can make new playlists and analyze them.
