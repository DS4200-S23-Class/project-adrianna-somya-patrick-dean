    <h1>Visualizing Spotify Song Attributes</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      Spotify has grown considerably over the past decade and has come up with
      multiple music recommendation systems such as Discover Weekly and Release
      Radar. However, users are given a strict list of songs for the week and do
      not have a choice over the songs they are suggested. We want to make a
      song recommendation visualization tool for music listeners that want to
      take more control of the music they listen to and see what makes up their
      music as well. We want to users to find new songs based on their personal
      choices instead of being confined to an algorithm. Currently on Spotify,
      users can also mark down that they don’t like a certain song, but that
      doesn’t prevent them from getting recommended more songs that they don’t
      like in the future. Using our tool, if users “dislike” a song that is
      chosen for them, they also have the option where we will “dislike” songs
      with similar features to the data point that was selected. Spotify also
      creates suggested playlists for its users based on a certain vibe, for
      example, Chill Mix. While some new music is introduced, most of the time
      the songs chosen are music that the user already listens to. So, another
      domain task we want to support is allowing users to curate personal
      playlists based on a “vibe,” which can be determined by song features such
      as danceability and valence.

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <h3>Data</h3>
      We have chosen to link our data visualization tool with the Spotify API.
      This library gives us access to an effectively endless amount of JSON
      metadata about the music and artists available on Spotify, as well as
      user-related data collected by the company playlists created by users as
      well as listening history. However, we used the API to manually create a
      database of ten thousand songs that we will use as the basis for our
      visualization. These songs will evenly span the top one thousand artists
      on Spotify so that users can discover new music across genres and musical
      features. The link to the spotify web API can be found here:
      https://api.spotify.com.
      <br />
      <br />
      The data we are using was collected by Spotify under the user privacy and
      data collection agreement that all users sign when creating a Spotify
      account. As such, all user-related data seem to have been collected in an
      ethical manner. However, it does not seem likely that users understand the
      depth of data collected, nor what Spotify uses it for, other than the
      customized playlists and summaries they surface to users. We believe it
      would be more ethical for Spotify to be more easily understandable and
      transparent about how they analyze and implement collected data, but the
      methods of collection themselves are not inherently unethical.
      <br />
      <br />
      Furthermore, it is difficult to identify potential sources of bias in the
      data provided by Spotify. All music and artist data are fairly
      objective—statistics such as artist popularity and number of streams are
      easy to count and bias-free. Similarly, user listening history is simply a
      queue of songs, so there is no way that collection and storage would
      introduce bias into the data set.
      <br />
      <br />
      Not much data cleaning is required when handling data received from the
      Spotify API. This is because the Spotify API responds to requests very
      efficiently, allowing data collection to be quite simple. In order to get
      the data we want, we iterated through the top 1000 artists on Spotify and
      got the top 10 tracks of each artist. Then, we requested the audio
      features for each track. There was no bad data involved and thus data
      cleaning was not a necessity. TODO: Add link to report, demo video, link
